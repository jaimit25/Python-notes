# Python Concepts and Data Structures

This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates fundamental Python concepts and various data structures, such as classes, inheritance, recursion, and more. The code also covers basic operations with strings, lists, stacks, queues, linked lists, and binary search trees (BST).

## Basic Python Concepts

### 1. Printing and User Input
- Demonstrates the use of `print()` to output messages and `input()` to take user input.

### 2. Variables and Data Types
- Covers different variable types like integers, strings, and floats. It also shows how to perform type conversion using `float()` and `str()`.

### 3. String Operations
- Explains common string operations such as converting to uppercase, replacing substrings, and finding substrings using `upper()`, `replace()`, and `find()`.

### 4. Operators in Python
- Covers basic operators, including integer and floating-point division, and exponentiation.

### 5. Conditional Statements (if-else)
- Demonstrates basic conditional statements for decision-making.

### 6. Loops
- Shows how to use both `while` and `for` loops for iteration.

### 7. Lists (Dynamic Arrays)
- Demonstrates how to work with lists, including accessing elements, slicing, inserting, and removing elements.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### 1. Classes and Objects (Encapsulation)
- Introduces the concept of classes and objects. It shows how to create a class and initialize its properties with a constructor.

### 2. Inheritance (Reusing and Extending Classes)
- Demonstrates inheritance where a subclass inherits properties and methods from a parent class, and how to extend functionality.

### 3. Polymorphism (Same Method Name, Different Behavior)
- Shows polymorphism, where different subclasses can implement their own version of a method with the same name.

### 4. Abstraction (Hiding Implementation Details)
- Explains abstraction with the use of abstract classes and methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. Recursion (A function calling itself)
- Demonstrates how recursion works by calculating the factorial of a number.

## Data Structures in Python

### 1. Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)
- Implements a stack using Python's list with `append()` and `pop()` operations.

### 2. Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)
- Implements a queue using the `deque` class from the `collections` module, with `append()` and `popleft()` operations.

### 3. Linked List (A collection of nodes)
- Demonstrates the basic implementation of a singly linked list with nodes containing data and a reference to the next node.

### 4. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Implements a simple binary search tree where nodes have at most two children. The insertion method follows the BST property.

## Explanation of Code Concepts

### Python Basics:
- **Input and Output:** `print()` and `input()` for displaying output and taking user input.
- **Variables and Types:** Variables hold values of different types, such as integers, strings, and floats.
- **Control Flow:** `if-else` for decision-making and loops (`while` and `for`) for iteration.
- **Data Structures:** Lists are mutable collections, while tuples are immutable. They can be used for storing collections of items.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- **Classes and Objects:** Classes define blueprints for objects. The `__init__` method initializes object properties.
- **Inheritance:** Subclasses inherit properties and methods from parent classes using `super()`.
- **Polymorphism:** Allows different classes to share the same method name but provide different implementations.
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes provide common methods to be implemented by subclasses.

### Recursion:
- Recursion is when a function calls itself, useful for problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems, like calculating factorials.

### Data Structures:
- **Stack (LIFO):** Last In, First Out structure using `append()` and `pop()`.
- **Queue (FIFO):** First In, First Out structure using `append()` and `popleft()`.
- **Linked List:** A series of nodes where each node points to the next node.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A tree structure with properties that ensure the left child is smaller than the parent and the right child is larger.
